# Pixel Maker Project (jQuery Version)

This pixel maker project was built utilizing HTML, CSS and jQuery. 

## About The Game

This game is a simple application that allows you to color the grid that you create with whatever color you choose from the palette. First the user chooses the height and width and then clicks the create grid button. They can then pick their color and create their masterpiece. There are additional options added in the jQuery version of the pixel maker which includes an option to save your work as a pdf and clear your grid without having to create a new grid. For this version of the pixelmaker, flexbox was used to make it responsive on all devices.

This project was also created in vanilla JavaScript which you can see by clicking [here](http://www.designsbyregina.com/projects/pixelmakerjavascript/index.html).
